## Mechanism
The Project F1 system works by reading driver and lap time data from text files, processing the data to calculate various metrics, and generating reports based on the processed data. Users can interact with the system through a command-line interface to load data, calculate metrics, and generate reports.

### Detailed Workflow
1. **Initialization**: The system loads driver and lap time data from `f1_drivers.txt` and `lap_times_*.txt` files.
2. **Data Processing**: The system processes the data to calculate various metrics such as average lap times, fastest laps, and driver rankings.
3. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the system through a series of command-line prompts.
4. **Reporting**: The system generates reports based on the processed data, providing insights into driver performance and race statistics.
5. **Data Persistence**: Any changes made during the session are saved back to the text files to ensure data persistence.
